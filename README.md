# Synthetic Test Case Dataset for ARTeMIS
Agent-based Rewriting and Test Case Management with Intelligent Supervision

This repository contains synthetic data generated to evaluate the generalization capability of the ARTeMIS system. The data includes:

- `synthetic_test_steps.csv`: Generated test steps (valid and invalid)
- `prompts_to_generate_synthetic_test_steps.pdf`: Prompt guidelines used for data generation

All examples were validated by QA professionals. This resource supports reproducibility and further research in test case rewriting using LLMs and agent-based architectures.
