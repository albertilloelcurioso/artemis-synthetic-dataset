# Synthetic Test Case Dataset for ARTeMIS

This repository contains synthetic data generated to evaluate the generalization capability of the ARTeMIS system. The data includes:

- `synthetic_dataset.csv`: Generated test steps (valid and invalid)
- `generation_prompts.pdf`: Prompt guidelines used for data generation

All examples were validated by QA professionals. This resource supports reproducibility and further research in test case rewriting using LLMs and agent-based architectures.
