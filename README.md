# Synthetic Test Case Dataset for ARTeMIS
Agent-based Rewriting and Test Case Management with Intelligent Supervision

This repository contains synthetic data generated to evaluate the generalization capability of the ARTeMIS system. The data includes:

- `synthetic_summary_test.csv `: Generated summary test cases (valid and invalid)
- `synthetic_initial_setup_test`: Generated summary test cases (valid and invalid)
- `synthetic_test_steps.csv`: Generated test steps (valid and invalid)
- `prompts_to_generate_synthetic_test_steps.pdf`: Prompt guidelines used for data generation
- `prompts_to_generate_synthetic_summary_and_initial_setup`: Prompt guidelines used for data generation
- `initial_setup_train.csv`: Training for initial setup
- `summary_train`: Training for summary
- `test_steps_trian`: Training for test steps

All examples were validated by QA professionals. This resource supports reproducibility and further research in test case rewriting using LLMs and agent-based architectures.
